# Rock-or-Mine-predictor
The model takes sonar data and predicts weather there is a rock or a mine undrneath.

1. We group data according to mine or a rock and find the mean value, teh observation is that for every column the mean value for the mine is higher than the rock.

2. Then we will split teh training and test data.

3. We will use the logistic regression model to train our data.

4. The accuracy in our case comes out to be around 83.4% on training data and 76% for our test data.
