# Rock-or-Mine-predictor
The model takes sonar data and predicts whether there is a rock or a mine underneath.

1. We group data according to mine or rock and find the mean value. The observation is that for every column, the mean value for the mine is higher than the rock.

2. Then we will split the training and test data.

3. We will use the logistic regression model to train our data.

4. The accuracy in our case comes out to be around 83.4% on the training data and 76% on the test data.
